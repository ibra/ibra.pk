Loose knot. Overflowing  
cup: yards of rope dripping  
out an incessant rim of Feel.  
<br>
What wreck? What salvage?  
Tore half the tickets to  
the longest train.  
<br>
Hire a conductor and feel smatterings  
of alive in the illusion of  
his expertise.  
<br>
Terrible at precision tools and  
gauging the anatomy of  
his own decisions.
