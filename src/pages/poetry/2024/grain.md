You want a fervid love;  
blistering. Burnt my tongue  
on soup you prepare for  
God Knows Who.  
<br>
The silo is empty and  
im stuffing it with rye,  
malt, jaan. From that  
tote bag and whatever  
I can get my hands on.  
<br>
Longing coiled around my skin is vitiation.  
<br>
Desire is a friend that  
begs for estrangement.  
<br>
So I keep the vacuum running.
