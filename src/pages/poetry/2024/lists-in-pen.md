Since a measure of bullet points never  
suited the Free. As ink started to settle over  
sand and your erased ghosts of Devotion  
<br>
bled into naked paper. Canvas for another  
pretty drawing. Another overdose. Another  
lifetime of putting up. Selling marked tickets.
<br>  
The cuts in the glint of his eye and the  
burns outside. The flares scorching his  
iris and the gaps in his hands failing  
<br>
to fling them away. Blinded to reap  
from the gardens in which he keeps tilling.  
Balancing his weights on the same beams.
<br>  
Sand in hourglass. Measured and eroding.  
Self is what he misses in his mirrors.  
So he writes his lists in pen now.
