Not quite that Grief is immutable  
or the windmill trouble turns.  
<br>
Tracing blunt needles is  
my new twenty four seven  
after all.  
<br>

Reciprocity and I untied the knot  
and it was violent, violent.  
<br>
Worms, the human benchmark,  
walking their miserable turn.  
<br>
Spots etched onto your cornea /  
Make me the wretched sin-eater.  
<br>
That's the new stamp and it's her
shift at the post office.
