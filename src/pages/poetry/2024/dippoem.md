I am the water and I am it's stillness.  
Seafoam slipping through the cracks.  
<br>
The kind that doesn't like to remember.
<br>
No stagnancies, no ebbing beauty.  
No calm after the stormâ€” only Drench.  
<br>
Fountain orchestry. Puddle depth.
<br>
Short dip. Luminescent flash. Shone the brightest. Went out the fastest.
Settled tide.  
<br>
No use to the skipper.
